<p>
The attendance control system is an application that has two types of users: administrators and employees. 
Both types of users have access to the attendance record, employee view and biweekly reports. However, only 
administrators can perform additional tasks such as adding new users, updating information for existing users, 
deregistering users, and viewing the list of deregistered employees in the system. 
<br>
<br>
The system works with a database essential for its operation, where the data of each user is stored and attendance records are kept, including entries
  and exits.
