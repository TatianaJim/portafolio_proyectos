AgroInvent is a web application designed to improve inventory management in the agricultural sector. This tool allows users to record, monitor and update detailed information on agricultural products and suppliers. In addition, it has features such as alerts for replenishment and the registration of product arrivals and departures, thus facilitating the maintenance of an accurate and up-to-date inventory. To ensure the proper functioning of the application, a database has been created consisting of several tables that manage all relevant information, including users, products, suppliers, companies, orders, incoming and outgoing products, and categories to classify products and simplify your search.
